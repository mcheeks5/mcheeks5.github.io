This is a GitHub account. It will contain some projects.

I created this repository in order to learn how to create repositories.

When I downloaded GitHub Desktop, I was given the option to clone a repository from the internet. I chose the only one I had made (this) one, chose a folder for it to clone to, and let it clone the repository.
